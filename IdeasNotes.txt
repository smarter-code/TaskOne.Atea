#Potential Improvements
1- Use paging when retrieving logs in order to limit returned payload size
2- Add IaaC (Terraform/Bicep/ARM) to automate infra. creation
3- Write integration and unit tests to increase resiliency
4- CI/CD pipelines
5- Use GitHub codespaces to automatically create cloud development environment for other developers (if the project security allows)
6- Store configs in AppConfig and Secrets to KeyVault
7- Use permissions limited SAS token to access the storage account
8- Authenticate the API and the Azure Function using MSI against AppConfig and KeyVault
9- Add application insights monitoring
10- Refactor logic in the controllers/Azure functions to a MediatR service layer to reduce platform coupling and enable logic reuse somewhere else
11- Separate repos and services into different class libraries

#Challenges
1- Choose a good partion key/row key to store the log data for efficent querying
